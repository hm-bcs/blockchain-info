# Blockchain

## What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a cryptographically secure way to store an ever growing list of records.
These records could be many things, such as transactions in a ledger, or state changes to the block.
Blockchains are resistant from tampering by having each block contain a hashed reference to the previous block.
They are managed within peer to peer networks and do not require a centralised authority to be considered valid.
Validity is ensured by a majority consensus of the blockchain.

## History
Bitcoin was the first implementation of a blockchain.
It used as a currency system online, without requiring a governing body.

## Terminology

#### Consensus
A consensus is a way in which distributed systems can make a decision where there are faults.
For example, a blockchain that has two different histories. The consensus is how the remaining nodes decide which of the two histories are correct. They could, for example agree by a majority.

#### Notary
A notary is someone that is able to legally witness transactions.
For example, with banks -> govt regulators.*
Consensus notary.*
